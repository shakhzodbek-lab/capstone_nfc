Sure, I can help you with that! For face recognition on a Raspberry Pi, you can use the OpenCV library along with a pre-trained deep learning model for face recognition, such as the Dlib library. Here's a simple example to get you started:

First, you'll need to install the required libraries. OpenCV and Dlib can be installed using the following commands:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install dlib
```

Now, let's create a basic script for face recognition:

```python
import cv2
import dlib

# Load the pre-trained face detector from Dlib
detector = dlib.get_frontal_face_detector()

# Load the pre-trained face recognition model from Dlib
predictor = dlib.shape_predictor("shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat")
facerec = dlib.face_recognition_model_v1("dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat")

# Load a sample image (replace this with your camera capture logic)
image = cv2.imread("sample_image.jpg")

# Convert the image to grayscale for face detection
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Detect faces in the grayscale image
faces = detector(gray)

# Loop over each detected face
for face in faces:
    # Get the facial landmarks for the face
    shape = predictor(gray, face)
    
    # Get the 128-dimension face encoding
    face_descriptor = facerec.compute_face_descriptor(image, shape)
    
    # You can store the face descriptor and associated NFC ID in your database here
    # For simplicity, let's just print the face descriptor for now
    print("Face Descriptor:", face_descriptor)

# Display the image with rectangles around the detected faces
for face in faces:
    x, y, w, h = face.left(), face.top(), face.width(), face.height()
    cv2.rectangle(image, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)

cv2.imshow("Face Recognition", image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

Note:

1. Make sure to replace "sample_image.jpg" with the path to the image you want to use or modify the script to capture images from a camera.
2. The face recognition model files ("shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat" and "dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat") can be downloaded from the Dlib website.

This is a basic example, and you may need to adapt it to your specific requirements. Additionally, you'll need to integrate this with your NFC logic for a complete project.
